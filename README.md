To verify the findings of the report
copy the 'ran_datasets' folder into the 'toy_datasets folder'
Start a jupyter notebook
Start the 'meta_model_regression_analysis' notebook
And run the desired book by spesifiying the name in the 'dataset_names' variable

You can create a new example by creating datasets using the file jypyter notebook 'creating_toy_datasets_friedman'
and changing the variables [n_samples,random_state, amount_datasets, noise, window_size, shift_dataset]

To run the different files, open the notebook 'run_models_regression' and spesify which datasets it should run by editing the variable 'run_dataset'
